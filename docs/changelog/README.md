# Changelog generation

A description of all the changes made to the nextsimdg code can automatically be generated anytime and is visible [here]()

To generate it, you need to download the code locally on your computer and you need to install the [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator). 

As described [here](https://github.com/Ic3fr0g/autochangelog-hook) you will also need the scripts gathered here :
  - the bash script [run_changelog.sh](https://github.com/nextsimdg/nextsimdg/blob/issue125_version_changelog/docs/changelog/run_changelog.sh)
  - the python script [clog.py](https://github.com/nextsimdg/nextsimdg/blob/issue125_version_changelog/docs/changelog/clog.py)

When everything is ready, you run the run_changelog.sh script and it will produce the [changelog file](https://github.com/nextsimdg/nextsimdg/blob/issue125_version_changelog/docs/changelog/CHANGELOG.md)
